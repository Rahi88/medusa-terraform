# Medusa E-Commerce Backend Deployment

## Project Overview

This project showcases the deployment of the Medusa headless commerce platform using AWS ECS/Fargate. It incorporates Terraform for infrastructure setup and GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

### What is Medusa?

Medusa is an open-source, headless commerce platform that provides a flexible and scalable backend for e-commerce applications. It allows for extensive customization and integration with various front-end technologies.

### Project Components

1. **Medusa Backend:** Manages core e-commerce functions like product management, orders, and payments.
2. **AWS ECS/Fargate:** Runs Medusa in a containerized environment, providing scalability and serverless compute capabilities.
3. **Terraform:** Automates the provisioning of AWS infrastructure, including networking, compute resources, and database services.
4. **GitHub Actions:** Handles the CI/CD process, automating the build, test, and deployment of the Medusa application.

### Key Steps

1. **Set Up Infrastructure:**
   - Define and provision AWS resources using Terraform, including VPC, ECS cluster, Fargate service, and RDS database.

2. **Configure CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Use GitHub Actions to automate the process of building the Medusa Docker image, pushing it to Amazon ECR, and deploying it to ECS.

3. **Deploy and Monitor:**
   - Deploy the Medusa backend and monitor its performance using AWS CloudWatch for logs and metrics.

### Purpose

This project aims to provide a robust, scalable e-commerce backend solution by leveraging modern cloud technologies and automation practices. It demonstrates the application of Terraform and GitHub Actions for efficient and repeatable deployments.
